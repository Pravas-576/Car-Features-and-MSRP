# Car Features and MSRP
## About the data we are going to explore today !
since I am a huge fan of Cars, I got a very beautiful data set from Kaggle which I am going to do Exploratory data analysis by using the Python. The data set contains more than 10,000 rows and more than 10 columns containing features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Tranmission Type, Highway MPG, City MPG and many more.
